type: Generative Music App for iOS
description: AnalogKit is a complex generative audio app that allows users to build, share and play modular synthesizers and digital audio effects processors. As the UI/UX lead, my challenge was to create a UI that merged the visual language of hardware synths with conventions of iOS apps, as well as craft effective ways of using the limited real estate of a tablet to build deep, complex pieces of virtual music gear. 
tools: 'Axure, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects'

                <h3>Build, Share and Play</h3>
                <p>The AnalogKit interface has to accomplish two very different tasks - building and tweaking projects, and then performing with those modules in a live environment. My solution was a 'play mode' where modules and connections locked into position and the user could treat their iPad more like a conventional piece of music hardware.</p>

                <h3>Modular Audio Building</h3>
                <p>AnalogKit ships with dozens of modules and interface components that users can wire together in any way they choose. My goal was to create modules that were easy to tell apart from one another, easy to interact with in a hurry, and efficient in their use of space.</p>

                <h3>Menus and Type</h3>
                <p>Each module in AnalogKit has a variety of available settings. I crafted a system of menus and popups that harkened back to some of the awesome design and typography that I love on vintage audio hardware.</p>

                <h3>The AK Menu</h3>
                <p>Users who build for any length of time will find themselves with hundreds of modules that they'll use while building. The AK menu is a contextual menu that gives users access to their own components as well as shared components from users they follow.</p>

                <p>In addition to designing AnalogKit itself, I created SXSW promotional materials, ads for a Facebook campaign, and all our press releases and whitepaper. Our team got a great response from users and appeared on several audio-related podcasts and a Reddit AMA.</p>

                <p>A highly complex app, AnalogKit required extensive prototyping. Axure RP let me generate clickable prototypes that I could view on my iPad to help figure out how to build an interface that was both quck to use and easy to understand.</p>
