                            <p>My name's Steve Rokitka (Rocketkar) - I'm a designer, writer and artist. I've been making things with words and images for most of my life, and doing it professionally for the better part of a decade. In that time I've designed a top-selling iOS app, created numerous websites and web assets, and designed enough t-shirts that they account for roughly half my wardrobe.</p> 

                            <p>I spent three of the last four years as UI/UX lead at a startup, building a complex generative music app and all the assets, marketing materials, websites, and promo schwag that goes along with it. Once the app was released, I decided to take some time off and cross a few (okay, most) of the items off my bucket list. I painted a house, bought a motorcycle and learned to ride, took a Wilderness First Responder course, spent six months learning to fix cars at a community college, and continued my training in Krav Maga.</p>

                            <p>Taking a break from design was really incredible in that it helped deprogram me from a lot of the things that were holding me back professionally. From working with cars I learned to find something to measure to determine whether a job was successful. From training Krav Maga I learned how even a master continues to train and retrain their fundamentals. From getting first responder certfication I learned how a professional doesn't show up to a situation and take on that situation's energy - they show up and set the tone for how a problem is going to get solved.</p> 

                            <p>Today, I'm back at work as a freelancer, and looking for awesome projets that I can be a part of. I've recently designed two novels, a corporate website, a nonprofit's brand identity, and in my opinion, I'm doing the best work of my life. If you've got something that needs solutions found, ideas given form, stories discovered or just a bit of snark interjected into a situation, drop me a line and let's get started.</p>

Steve was a recommended freelancer and we couldn't have been more pleased with our decision to bring him on to pick-up where we left off. We were under pressure to quickly launch--Steve listened to our vision, provided valuable input, communicated expectations and delivered on a schedule that met our challenging launch date. Steve worked very well on his own and "managed the client" very well--delivering regular but not overly detailed status reports and doing well to understand our industry and client landscape."</p>
